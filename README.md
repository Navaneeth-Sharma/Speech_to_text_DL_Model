# Speech Recognition Using 1D convnet

Here the input data is the samples of word like cat,dog,etc.I have created my own data set containing 11 labels and 85 sounds for each label.The duration is for 1 sec.

I am using time series data to train and predict the model.Since the data contains the amplitude and the time for perticular word, I am using the samples of the sound data of the word.
